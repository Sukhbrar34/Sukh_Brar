**APPLICATION LAYER -7** /n
What it does: Interfaces with end-user applications (e.g., browsers, email clients).

Purpose: Enables user interaction with network services.

Examples: HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP

📌**What the user sees and interacts with**
**EXAMPLE**: For example, when you open your web browser and go to www.bank.com, your browser uses the HTTPS protocol, which operates at the Application Layer, to communicate with the bank’s server.
This layer manages the data exchange between your browser and the server, making sure you receive the correct webpage.
When you click on enter to search website, computer gets data ready to transfer to next layer

**TRANSPORT LAYER- 4**
Think about how can we transport the data? how to get it to destination?
Here comes 2 options - TCP OR UDP ?
Simply, TCP - more reliable but not very fast    UDP - not reliable but fast

Feature	TCP 🛡️
Connection     :	Connection-oriented (3-way handshake)
Reliability    :	Guaranteed delivery
Ordering	     :Ensures data arrives in order
Error checking :	Yes – uses acknowledgments and retransmissions
Speed	         :Slower (due to checks)
Use cases      :	Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP)

**Example**: You’re downloading a software file — every piece must arrive, in the right order, or the file won’t work. That’s TCP.

Feature	UDP 🚀
Connection    :	Connectionless
Reliability	  :No guarantees
Ordering	    :No sequencing
Error checking:	Minimal (optional checksum)
Speed	        : Faster (no error recovery)
Use cases	    :Live video/audio streaming, online gaming, VoIP (calls), DNS queries

**Example**:You’re in a Zoom call — it’s more important that the video/audio keeps flowing than waiting for lost packets. That’s UDP.

**
What it does: Ensures reliable data transfer (or fast, best-effort delivery).

Purpose: Breaks data into segments, manages delivery, checks for errors.

Examples: TCP, UDP, Port numbers

📌 **Delivers your data reliably or quickly—your choice.**

In this layer, layer 4 header means destination port, source port, UDP/TCP data delivery information is added along with data for transferring.

Here, adding layer 4 information with application layer data is called encapsulation.
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data with the necessary protocol information so it can be properly transmitted over a network.
