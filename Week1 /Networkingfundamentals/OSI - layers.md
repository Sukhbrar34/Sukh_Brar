# **APPLICATION LAYER - 7**

### What it does:
Interfaces with end-user applications (e.g., browsers, email clients).

### Purpose:
Enables user interaction with network services.

### Examples:
- HTTP
- FTP
- DNS
- SMTP

📌 **What the user sees and interacts with**

**Example:**  
When you open your web browser and go to www.xyzbank.com, your browser uses the HTTPS protocol, which operates at the Application Layer, to communicate with the bank’s server.  
This layer manages the data exchange between your browser and the server, making sure you receive the correct webpage.  
When you click "Enter" to search a website, the computer gets the data ready to transfer to the next layer, like:  

```
|DATA 📄|
```

**Add Application Layer (L7) Info**  
```
[App Header + 📄 Data] --> ✉️
```

# **TRANSPORT LAYER - 4**

Think about **how to transport the data**—how to get it to the destination?  
There are **two options**: **TCP** or **UDP**.  

### TCP 🛡️
- **Connection:** Connection-oriented (3-way handshake)  
- **Reliability:** Guaranteed delivery  
- **Ordering:** Ensures data arrives in order  
- **Error checking:** Yes – uses acknowledgments and retransmissions  
- **Speed:** Slower (due to checks)  
- **Use cases:** Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP)  

**Example:**  
You’re downloading a software file — every piece must arrive, in the right order, or the file won’t work. That’s TCP.

---

### UDP 🚀
- **Connection:** Connectionless  
- **Reliability:** No guarantees  
- **Ordering:** No sequencing  
- **Error checking:** Minimal (optional checksum)  
- **Speed:** Faster (no error recovery)  
- **Use cases:** Live video/audio streaming, online gaming, VoIP (calls), DNS queries  

**Example:**  
You’re in a Zoom call — it’s more important that the video/audio keeps flowing than waiting for lost packets. That’s UDP.

---

### What it does:
Ensures reliable data transfer (or fast, best-effort delivery).

### Purpose:
Breaks data into segments, manages delivery, checks for errors.

### Examples:
- TCP
- UDP
- Port numbers

📌 **Delivers your data reliably or quickly—your choice.**

In this layer, the Layer 4 header includes:  
- **Destination port**
- **Source port**
- **UDP/TCP data delivery information**

This is added along with the data for transferring, like:  
```
|APP DATA|L4 HEADER|
```

Here, **adding Layer 4 information** with Application Layer data is called **encapsulation**.  
**Encapsulation** is the process of wrapping data with the necessary protocol information so it can be properly transmitted over a network.

**Add Transport Layer (L4) Info (e.g., TCP/UDP)**  
```
