🛠️ Troubleshooting Methodology 

 When things go wrong with tech (and they will 😅), this 7-step method helps you stay calm and fix it like a pro!

 1. 🔍 Identify the Problem
Start with gathering clues like a digital detective 🕵️‍♀️.
Steps:
Gather information             :    Check error messages, logs, and ask “What happened?”

Duplicate the problem (if safe):    Can you recreate the issue?

Question users                 :   "What were you doing when it broke?" 🧑‍💻

Identify symptoms              :    Is it slow? Crashing? Not loading?

Check for recent changes       :    New software, updates, cables unplugged?

Separate issues                :   Handle one problem at a time.

💡 Tip: Don’t assume. Confirm every detail.

2. 🌐 Research (Knowledge Base / Internet)
If you're stuck, don’t reinvent the wheel. Someone may have solved it before.

✅ Look into:
Product manuals or help guides

Manufacturer websites

Tech forums (e.g., Stack Overflow, Spiceworks)

Support articles or YouTube demos

🧠 "Google is your best friend" (in IT, anyway).

3. 🧠 Establish a Theory of Probable Cause
Time to make an educated guess based on what you know.

✅ Tips:
Question the obvious: Is it plugged in? Is the Wi-Fi on? 🧍‍♂️⚡

Multiple causes? Start with the most likely.

Use Divide and Conquer: Narrow it down step-by-step (e.g., is it a hardware or software issue?)

4. 🧪 Test the Theory
Now test your theory to confirm the real issue.

✅ Actions:
If the theory is correct: 🎯 Move to fixing it.

If it fails: 🔁 Try another theory or escalate to a higher-level tech.

5. Establish a Plan of Action
Create a step-by-step game plan to fix it without causing more problems.

✅ Include:
Backup plan or rollback options 🛑

Consider how the fix affects other systems

Schedule downtime if needed ⏰

6.🛠️ Implement the Solution (or Escalate)
Apply the fix.

If it's beyond your level or permissions, escalate to your senior tech or supervisor 🚨

7. Verify Full System Functionality & Prevent Future Issues
Make sure everything works after the fix.

✅ Checklist:
Can users use the system normally again?

Any errors?

Can it be prevented in the future? Add patches, train users, update configs.

8. Document findings, lessons learned, actions taken and end outcomes.
Finding + learnings + actions + outcomes = lnowledge base
In future, if someones gets the similar problem, they can go through our knowledge base to fix the problem.
