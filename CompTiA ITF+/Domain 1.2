Welcome!🚀 
In this guide, we explore the **fundamental data types** you need to know for **CompTIA ITF+**.  
Let’s break it down — simply, clearly, and a little bit fun! :)

1. Char (Character)

🎯 What is it?
- Char = a "single character". One letter, number, or symbol.
- Always written in single quotes ('').

Examples:
'A', '7', '$', '@'

2.STRING
🎯 What is it?
A String = a bunch of characters all together (like a word or a sentence).
Written in double quotes (" ").

Examples:
"Hello", "12345", "CompTIA Rocks!"

3. Numbers 🔢
Numbers in coding can be two main types: Integers and Floats.

a) Integer
An Integer is a whole number — no decimal points.Can be + or -.
Example: -10, 0, 42, 2025

b)Float (Floating-Point Number)
A Float is a number that has a decimal point.
Examples: 3.14, -0.001, 1000.50


COMPARISON TABLE
Data Type	        What It Stores	        Example	        Special Note
Char	            Single character	       'A'	          Only one symbol
String	          Text (many chars)	       "Hello"	      Words, sentences
Integer          	Whole numbers            	42	          No decimals
Float	            Decimal numbers	          3.14	        Can have tiny rounding errors

4. What is a Boolean in Programming?
🎯 Quick Definition:
A **Boolean expression** in coding is a question that can only be answered with **YES or NO**, or **TRUE or FALSE**, or **ON or OFF**.  
No long stories. Just two options. ✅❌

🔥 Real-Life Example:
Imagine you are using a fitness app 🏋️‍♂️ that checks if you are overweight.

- If your weight is **220**, the app says:  
  👉 **YES** (you are overweight)

- If your weight is **60**, the app says:  
  👉 **NO** (you are not overweight)

## Code-like Thinking:
(python)
if weight > 150:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
