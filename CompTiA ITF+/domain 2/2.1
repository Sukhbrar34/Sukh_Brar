# 🧱 02 - Infrastructure

Welcome to the foundation of the digital world! Let’s break down what makes computers work together and how devices get connected. ⚙️🌐

🔌 Wired Connections
Definition: A wired connection uses physical cables (like Ethernet or USB) to connect devices to a network or other devices.

📶 Wireless Connections
Definition: A wireless connection uses radio waves or other wireless signals to connect devices without physical cables.

GRAPHIC DEVICE INTERFACES
Graphic device interfaces connect displays (monitors, projectors, TVs) to computers and other output sources. 
These interfaces can carry "video signals" — and in many cases, "audio too".

1.VGA (Video Graphics Array)
| Feature          | Description                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 🔌 Type           | Analog                                         |
| 📺 Use            | Older monitors and projectors                 |
| 📏 Pins           | 15-pin D-sub connector (blue)                 |
| 🎵 Audio Support  | ❌ No                                          |
| 📉 Max Res        | Up to 1080p (but analog quality)              |

#Analog means the signal is sent as a continuous electrical wave rather than as binary digital data (0s and 1s).


2.HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface)
| Feature          | Description                                    |

| 📺 Use            | Modern TVs, monitors, gaming consoles         |
| 🎵 Audio Support  | ✅ Yes (video + audio in one cable)           |
| 📹 Max Res        | Up to 8K with HDMI 2.1                         |
| 🎮 Extra Use      | Supports CEC (remote control), Ethernet       |

> Most common home and multimedia display connection.

3.DVI(Digital Visual Interface)
| Feature          | Description                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 🔌 Type           | Digital or Analog                              |
| 📺 Use            | Older monitors and PCs                        |
| 🎵 Audio Support  | ❌ No (video only)                            |
| 📷 Variants       | DVI-D (Digital), DVI-A (Analog), DVI-I (Both) |
| 📹 Max Res        | Up to 1920x1200 (single link) or 2560x1600 (dual) |

 Looks chunky& white & bigger than VGA/HDMI; not used in newer devices.
 DVI gives good digital video.


4.DisplayPort
| Feature          | Description                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|

| 📺 Use            | High-end monitors, PCs                        |
| 🎵 Audio Support  | ✅ Yes                                         |
| ⚡ Max Res        | Up to 8K (with version 2.0)                    |
| 🔁 Other Use      | Can carry USB and other signals (like USB-C)  |
Preferred for high refresh rate gaming and pro displays.
It allows high resolution - High resolution refers to the number of pixels on the screen.
The more pixels = sharper and clearer the image.

5.Mini DisplayPort
| Feature          | Description                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 🔌 Type           | Digital (smaller DisplayPort version)         |
| 📺 Use            | Compact laptops (especially older Macs)       |
| 🎵 Audio Support  | ✅ Yes                                         |
| 📐 Size           | Smaller than full-size DisplayPort            |
