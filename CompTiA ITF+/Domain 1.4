Welcome to Data and Information as Assets 📊
In this guide, we’ll explore how data and information are more valuable than ever and why businesses treat them like assets.
Ready to understand why data is so powerful? Let’s dive in! 🚀


What is Data and Information? 
Data are raw facts (e.g., numbers, names, dates), while information is organized data that has meaning.
Example: You have a list of temperatures recorded throughout the day.

Data:
25, 28, 30, 27, 26, 29, 31, 33
These are just raw numbers without any context. On their own, they don't tell us anything specific.
if you organize the data, it turns into meaningful information:

Information:
"The temperature during the day ranged from 25°C in the morning to 33°C in the afternoon."


Why Is Data an Asset? 💰
Just like how your house or car is a valuable asset, so is data! 
Businesses use data to make informed decisions, predict trends, and improve strategies.
The more useful data a company has, the better decisions they can make!

Data:
3, 5, 2, 8, 7, 6, 4 (Number of items purchased by customers each day for a week)

This is raw data—just a series of numbers without much meaning.

Information:
"Over the past week, the average number of items sold per day was 5. 
The highest sales day was Day 4 with 8 items sold, and the lowest was Day 3 with only 2 items sold."

4. Intellectual Property (IP)
