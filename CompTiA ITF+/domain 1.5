Compare and contrast common units of measure:
1.Storage Units (how much data is stored)

Bit (b) – Smallest unit of data (0 or 1)

Byte (B) – 1 Byte = 8 bits

Kilobyte (KB) – 1 KB = 1,024 Bytes

Megabyte (MB) – 1 MB = 1,024 KB

Gigabyte (GB) – 1 GB = 1,024 MB

Terabyte (TB) – 1 TB = 1,024 GB

Petabyte (PB) – 1 PB = 1,024 TB

2.🌐 Throughput Units (network data transfer speed)
(Usually measured per second – lowercase ‘b’ means bits)

bps – bits per second

Kbps – Kilobits per second (1,000 bps)

Mbps – Megabits per second (1,000 Kbps)

Gbps – Gigabits per second (1,000 Mbps)

Tbps – Terabits per second (1,000 Gbps)

🔹 Tip: Internet speeds are usually in Mbps, while files are measured in MB – don't confuse them!


3.⚙️ Processing Speed Units (CPU clock speed)

Megahertz (MHz) – 1 MHz = 1 million cycles/second

Gigahertz (GHz) – 1 GHz = 1,000 MHz = 1 billion cycles/second

🧠 Higher GHz usually means a faster CPU, but actual performance depends on more than just clock speed (like cores and architecture).

Terabyte (TB)                	1,024 GB	                                  Tons of data	                                            External hard drives
Petabyte (PB)               	1,024 TB	                                  Massive storage	                                Data centers, cloud giants (e.g., Google)

🌐 Throughput Units – “How fast can data travel over the network?”

Unit	               Stands for	                 Speed	                Real-World Comparison
bps	               Bits per second	            🐌 Super slow           	Morse code over a wire
Kbps	              Kilobits/sec	               1,000 bps	              Dial-up internet speed 😅
Mbps	              Megabits/sec	               1,000 Kbps	              Streaming Netflix (standard HD) 📺
Gbps	              Gigabits/sec	               1,000 Mbps	              Fiber optic internet ⚡
Tbps	              Terabits/sec	               1,000 Gbps	              Backbone of the internet 🧠🌍

📌 Important:
1 Byte = 8 bits ➜ 100 Mbps internet ≠ 100 MBps file download!
To convert Mbps to MBps ➜ divide by 8.
